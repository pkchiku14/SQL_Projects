# My SQL Learning Journey: Hands-on Practice and Project

Hello there! Welcome to my SQL Learning Journey, where I've documented my progress and achievements in mastering SQL concepts. Within this repository, you'll find two key SQL files that represent my dedication and growth throughout the course.

## Files Overview

1. [SQL Essentials.sql](https://github.com/pkchiku14/SQL_Projects/blob/main/SQL_essential_LinkedIn_Learning/SQL%20Essentials.sql)
Step into my shoes and explore the 'SQL Essentials.sql' file â€“ a compilation of hands-on practice exercises that have been instrumental in my SQL learning adventure. These exercises aren't just lines of code; they reflect my determination to understand everything from basic queries to intricate JOIN operations and subqueries. Dive into this file to witness my practical skills evolving and my problem-solving abilities taking shape.

2. [challenges WDSA database.sql](https://github.com/pkchiku14/SQL_Projects/blob/main/SQL_essential_LinkedIn_Learning/challenges%20WDSA%20database.sql)
The 'challenges WDSA database.sql' file encapsulates my triumphs as I tackled the course project head-on. These solutions showcase my creativity in implementing SQL in real-world scenarios. Feel free to explore, adapt, and learn from my approach to the project.

## How I Got Here

1. Getting Started : This learning and Project is based on a course on LinkedIn Learning. The course name is "SQL Essential Training by Walter Shields" and the link for it can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933).
2. Practicing more and more! : To practice the queries, I used another website [SQL zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).


## Contributing

While this journey was primarily personal, I also value the power of collaboration and growth through shared knowledge. If you spot any room for improvement, have suggestions, or want to add new exercises, I encourage you to contribute. Let's learn together!

## Shoutout

I extend my gratitude to the creators of the course content that ignited my passion for SQL and enabled me to compile this repository.

Thank you for joining me on this remarkable expedition of SQL mastery. Happy learning!
